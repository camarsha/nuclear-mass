* nuclear-mass
This common lisp system includes tools that should make calculations involving
nuclear masses as painless as possible.

** Examples

#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :nuclear-mass)
  (nuclear-mass:get-atomic-mass "23na")
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 22.98976928195

#+begin_src lisp
  (nuclear-mass:get-nuclear-mass "23na") ;; subtracts binding energy
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 22.983739681707874

You can change to different versions of AME:

#+begin_src lisp
    (reduce #'-
            (nuclear-mass:with-mass-table (nuclear-mass:mass93 nuclear-mass:mass20)
      (nuclear-mass:atomic-units->kev (nuclear-mass:get-atomic-mass "20mg"))))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 92.8196613304317

Indicating that the mass of $^{20}$Mg was 93 keV greater in AME 1993 compared to 2020.

ENSDF is also included, and is automatically updated whenever the package is loaded.
#+begin_src lisp
  (nuclear-mass:get-ground-state-spin "23na") 
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3/2+

You can look for levels that match a lab-frame resonance energy.
#+begin_src lisp
  (mapc (lambda (level)
            (print level))
          (nuclear-mass:find-states-near-resonance 170.0 "1h" "23na" :delta 20.0))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: (#<NUCLEAR-MASS::LEVEL {Ex=11860 | Jpi=(8+)}>
:  #<NUCLEAR-MASS::LEVEL {Ex=11862.8 | Jpi=1-}>)
